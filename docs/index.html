                        I've worked professionally on front end, back end, and game development.
                        Additionally, I have years of experience both volunteering and working as a programming instructor.
                        If you're interested in learning more, I've detailed specifics in my <a href="assets/AidanP_Resume.pdf">Resume</a>. 
                        Alternatively, you can read my code on <a href="https://github.com/aidanparkhurst">Github</a>.

                <p class="title"> Making Games </p>
                    <p class="subtext">
                        Like many, I was inspired to learn coding by my love for video games. It's been 9 years, and a whole lot of math classes
                        since I started on that journey, but I am still passionate about creating my own games. Along the way, I've made lots of
                        little games (Like <a href="https://aidanparkhurst.github.io/Wave">Wave</a>) But within the last 3 years, I've made a more focused
                        effort to grow as an illustrator, story-teller, and game developer. I'm super excited to share the results of these efforts
                         soon, but until then I'll leave you with some teaser concept art:

                <p class="title"> Breaking Games </p>
                    <p class="subtext">
                        Just as I love making games, I love seeing how other people make their games. Working backwards is a
                        fascinating way to understand the development process, and it feels like a superpower when I can dig
                        through someone else's assembly code to understand a tough boss, or find an exploit to become overpowered. 
                        Over on my <a href="https://github.com/aidanparkhurst/Than0s">Github</a>, you can read a sample of a CS:GO
                        cheat I made. That project was beyond fun, and helped me solidify a deep understanding of memory manipulation
                        and software decompiling

                        I couldn't be the man I am today, or the man I will be, without the support I've received from
                        family, friends, teachers, and competitors. I wouldn't be myself if the people in my life hadn't
                        shaped me, and I want to express my sincere gratitude for that.

                        I love to get some fresh air, longboarding or hiking with friends and family.

                        I'm also passionate about and inspired by art. Some of my all time favorite memories are in breathtaking Museums,
                        and chaotic concert crowds.
