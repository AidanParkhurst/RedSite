                <p> I'm currently a student at Boston University, pursuing my BA in Computer Science. </p>
                <p class="subtext">
                    My programming journey started much earlier though: At 12 years old, my love for videogames
                    inspired me to attend "Summertech," where I started developing my skills and passion for coding.
                    I later refined and built upon these skills in a specialized highschool for CS: Bergen County Academies.
                    Moving forward, I hope to be a lifelong student, learning and growing alongside the impactful,
                    creative field of computing.

                    Beyond that, I love to make and break games. Whether I'm coding them myself, or digging through
                    someone else's assembly, my passion for games and gamehacking is still a driving force in my programming journey.
                    Occasionally, I code tools to solve problems in my day to day, or websites like this.

                    I'm a son, a brother, and a friend. <br>
                    To me, a good life means sharing happiness and understanding whenever I can.

                    Apart from my screen, I love to get some fresh air with friends. Recently I've enjoyed hiking in New Hampshire,
                     lounging in the Boston Commons, and cruising down the steepest hills I can find on my longboard.
                    I'm also passionate about and inspired by art. Some of my favorite memories ever are in breathtaking Museums,
                    and chaotic crowds at live concerts.
                    Lastly, I also practice jiujitsu, a martial art focused on grappling. It's had tremendous positive impact on my
                    mental and physical health, and I've made meaningful friendships with lots of my training partners.
